# Offline Protocol SDK for Swift

Offline-first messaging for iOS: BLE mesh and internet relay transports, with
end-to-end encryption (MLS, RFC 9420) applied automatically.

This is the Swift package of the
[Offline Protocol SDK](https://github.com/Offline-Protocol/offline-protocol-sdk).
It needs no React Native.

## Install

In Xcode, add the package by URL and pick a version. In a manifest:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Offline-Protocol/offline-protocol-swift.git", from: "0.28.0")
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "YourApp", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "OfflineProtocolSDK", package: "offline-protocol-swift")
    ])
]
```

Requirements: iOS 13.0 or later. iOS only: the binary
has no macOS or Mac Catalyst slice.

## What is in it

| Part | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `offline_protocolFFI` | The Rust library, as an XCFramework for device and simulator |
| Generated bindings | `OfflineProtocol`, `ProtocolConfig`, `MeshServices`, `DataStore` and the rest of the API, generated from the Rust interface |
| Transports | The BLE, internet relay, Wi-Fi Direct, Nostr and Reticulum managers, the same sources the React Native module compiles |
| Storage | The Keychain store for MLS material and the file store for protocol state |

The Rust core is an I/O-free engine. It queues, routes and encrypts, and never
opens a socket or touches a radio for the protocol. A transport manager does
the I/O for one transport: it drains the engine's outbound queue, sends, and
hands inbound bytes back.

## Status

The storage providers are not yet public, so an application cannot construct
them, and wiring the transports to the engine is the application's to write.
A public entry point that does both is the next addition to this package.

What is public today is what the React Native module happened to need
public. It is not yet a decided API, and names in it may change before the
first release that says otherwise.

## Where this package comes from

This repository is generated. Every source in it is a copy of a file in
[offline-protocol-sdk](https://github.com/Offline-Protocol/offline-protocol-sdk),
written here by that repository's release workflow, and the `VERSION` file
names the commit. Changes made here are overwritten by the next release.
Issues and pull requests belong in the main repository.
