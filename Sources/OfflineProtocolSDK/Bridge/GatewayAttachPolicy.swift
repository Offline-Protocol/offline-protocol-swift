/// list because it needs the generated UniFFI module, so the SwiftPM harness
/// compiles none of it.

/// signs to attach are built and signed in the core, behind
/// `gatewayAddressDeclaration(challenge:)`. The relay's equivalent had to live
/// on this side because it commits the relay's account name, which only a
/// bridge knows, and it is now hand-mirrored in three languages. This one
/// commits our own address, so it exists once where the conformance vectors
/// can pin it. What is left here is the framing around it.
