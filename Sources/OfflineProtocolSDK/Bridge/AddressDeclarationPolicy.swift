import Foundation

/// Builds the `DeclareAddress` proof a relay connection needs to be routed by
/// address instead of by account name.
///
/// # Why the declaration exists
///
/// The relay authenticates a JWT and knows the connection by its *account
/// name*, but since the addressing cutover the core stamps `Message.sender`
/// with `local_address()`. A relay that attributes an inbound frame by account
/// name therefore hands the receiver a `transport_peer_id` that cannot match
/// the sender it is strict-matched against in `validate_transport_sender`, and
/// every security-gated control frame (`__MLS_KEY_PKG__`, `__MLS_WELCOME__`)
/// is rejected — no MLS session can be established over the relay at all.
/// Declaring closes that, and is also what makes an `off1…` recipient
/// resolvable in the relay's registry.
///
/// # Why the account name is inside the signed bytes
///
/// The signing key here is the identity key that also signs mesh control
/// frames under `offline-ctrl-v1`. If the proof were a signature over a bare
/// relay-chosen challenge, a hostile relay could hand out a challenge shaped
/// like a control-frame payload and harvest a signature that replays as a
/// control frame from this peer. Binding the domain **and** the account makes
/// the signature meaningful only as "this account, on this relay, holds this
/// key" — it cannot be replayed under another account, nor onto another
/// connection, since the challenge is minted per connection.
///
/// The layout is fixed by the relay's `address_binding::address_proof_payload`
/// and pinned there by a hex vector, which
/// `AddressDeclarationPolicyTests.proofPayloadMatchesThePinnedRelayVector`
/// mirrors byte for byte. Neither side may change it alone.
///
/// # Why every failure is a skip rather than an error
///
/// A connection that does not declare keeps working exactly as it did before
/// addresses existed — the relay attributes it by account name, which is the
/// legacy path and still the only path an older relay has. So the absence of
/// a capability, of a challenge, or of a local identity is a reason to stay
/// quiet, not to fail a connection that is otherwise fine.
