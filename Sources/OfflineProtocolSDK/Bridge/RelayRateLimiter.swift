// RelayRateLimiter.swift
// OfflineProtocol
//
// Client-side mirror of the relay's per-connection token bucket (30 burst,
// 10 refill/s). Every relay-bound frame takes a token before the socket
// write: URLSessionWebSocketTask's send() only proves a local write, so
// without this a poll batch or a large registration's member deltas can
// burst past the server bucket — the relay drops the overflow *after* the
// local write "succeeded", which would let the bridge confirm (and the
// translator commit) state the relay never recorded.
//
// Capacity/refill sit slightly under the relay's documented budget so the
// frames this limiter doesn't meter never tip the server bucket. There are
// exactly two, both one-per-connection handshake frames sent back to back
// before anything else: `Authenticate`, and the `DeclareAddress` that proves
// this connection's address. 2 unmetered + a 28 burst is the relay's 30, and
// 9/s stays under its 10/s from there. Neither may be metered: a full bucket
// would defer the frame the whole connection's identity depends on. A `false`
// from tryAcquire always means "defer the frame to a later tick", never
// "drop it".
//
// Callers pass `nowMs` explicitly (testability). Thread-safe. Mirrors
// android RelayRateLimiter.kt — keep in sync.
