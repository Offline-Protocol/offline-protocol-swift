import Foundation

/// Whether an account may read through to the legacy, un-namespaced secure
/// store that shipped before storage was scoped to `(app_id, user_id)`.
///
/// Scoping the store renamed it. Left alone, the first launch after an upgrade
/// would find an empty store, mint a *new* MLS signing identity, and abandon
/// every session, group, and TOFU pin the install already had — peers still
/// holding the old pin would then reject it. So the new store adopts the old
/// one instead.
///
/// Adoption is read-through rather than a bulk copy on purpose. The legacy
/// store's key types are not a closed set (OpenMLS contributes its own labels
/// and Python's keyring backend cannot enumerate at all), so there is no
/// reliable way to walk it. A miss in the new store consults the legacy one and
/// promotes what it finds, which is naturally idempotent and resumable.
///
/// The legacy store was shared by every account on the install, so at most one
/// account can inherit it. The first to launch writes a claim *and reads it
/// back* — an unverified claim is not an adoption, see `confirmClaim`; a second
/// account seeing a foreign claim gets a fresh identity — correct, because the
/// legacy store never held a separable identity for it — but must say so out
/// loud rather than rotate silently.
///
/// Read-through is also what the SDK's *protocol-state* adoption sweep rides
/// on: pre-split delivery state sits in this same un-namespaced store, and the
/// sweep enumerates the namespaced handle. So a conflict costs more than the
/// MLS identity — that account also comes up with an empty outbox, an empty
/// pending queue, and an empty **block list**, every previously blocked peer
/// unblocked. Say all of it, not just the identity.
///
/// Keep this policy in sync with `LegacyStoreAdoption.kt` and
/// `legacy_store_adoption.py`.
