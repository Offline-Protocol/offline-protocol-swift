// SupersededLatchPolicy.swift
// OfflineProtocol
//
// The relay-displacement ("session superseded") latch, extracted as a pure,
// Foundation-only state machine so it can be unit-tested without a live
// WebSocket (see tests/SupersededLatchPolicyTests.swift). InternetManager
// owns the threading (every call is made on main, the single writer); this
// type owns only the decision and the boolean.
//
// The relay closes a displaced connection with WebSocket close code 4000 (a
// newer registration for the same identity took the slot) and, redundantly,
// sends an application-level SessionSuperseded notice on the live socket
// first. Either signal must latch the transport stopped: a blind reconnect
// would just re-displace the peer socket in a ~1s loop — the fleet-wide
// eviction storm the relay-displacement rollout guards against. The latch is
// cleared only by an explicit start() (the app resolved "connected
// elsewhere" and re-enabled the transport).
//
// **This type is also the source of truth for the event that reports the
// latch**, not just the boolean behind it. `internet_session_superseded` is
// strictly one-shot — nothing ever restates it, and every reconnect route
// refuses while latched — so an emit the bridge drops leaves the app showing
// a relay connection that is never coming back. The fix is to re-derive the
// report from this state at a later trigger rather than to buffer a copy of
// the emit (see OfflineProtocolModule.applicationWillEnterForeground), which
// is why the event's type tag, its payload shape and its reason live here:
//
//   - Being here puts them in a file the SwiftPM harness compiles, the CI
//     `swiftc -typecheck` probe covers and a unit test pins. The bridge module
//     that would otherwise own the tag literal is compiled by neither, so a
//     typo there would pass every check in CI and silently mis-tag the event.
//   - Restatement needs the *reason* to survive as long as the latch does.
//     Held only by the emit's argument, it dies with the dropped emit and a
//     restatement could report the displacement but not why.
//
// Mirrors android/src/main/java/com/offlineprotocol/SupersededLatchPolicy.kt
// — keep in sync.
